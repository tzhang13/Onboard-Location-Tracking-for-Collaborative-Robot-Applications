# Onboard-Location-Tracking-for-Collaborative-Robot-Applications

As automation technology becomes more commonplace in manufacturing, the need for advanced, integrated
monitoring equipment and algorithms becomes increasingly vital. Through improvements made to external and
onboard tracking system (e.g., motion sensors and cameras), a workspace may be protected without requiring safety
fences, barriers, or other physical safeguards. In the field of robotics, it is crucial to know the location of both the human
workforce and the robotic equipment to ensure a safe working environment. This project investigates the performance
of networked, small-scale tracking sensors that will be integrated into parts and equipment for localization and
environment observation. Integrating tracking capabilities into equipment is expected to reduce localization
uncertainty, as it is not subject to occlusion or environmental influences such as temperature or changes in lighting.
Moreover, such tracking abilities would promote workforce safety and security and increase productivity of both people
and robots in warehouse, manufacturing, and construction facilities.

This project developed and evaluated an embedded small-scale sensor suite that can be integrated into robotic
configurations and wearable technologies to facilitate human-robot interactions. The sensor suite is responsible for
reporting three-dimensional positions and rotations within the Collaborative Robotics Laboratory. Small, robotmounted
platforms consisting of microcontrollers obtain raw data from inertial measurement units (IMUs), light
monitors, and distance sensors. Individual platforms are networked via wireless technologies, and sensor data is
transmitted to a host computer that maintains a model of the world as measured by the sensors. The raw data being
fed into the world model is noisy, so probabilistic noise models are used to compensate for measurement uncertainty.
Filtered pose information is then transmitted to an Android tablet held by a human operator. Performance of the
tracking system prototype was verified using an evaluative suite of test methods using industrial, collaborative robots
through a motion capture system.
